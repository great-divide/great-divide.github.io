So it turns out that I've been avoiding coding. And largely, I've been avoiding fixing up my front ends.

When I built these projects I was super into the Models and the logic. The front end was sort of a necessary evil that I didn't much effort into. "I need to get it working. I'll make it look good later" was my mantra.

And now it's later.

And those front ends need a makeover. And those style sheets need some attention.

I also need to give the nuts and bolts of a couple of projects some attention, and I suppose this is something that active, experienced developers deal with all the time:  of all the many projects I could work on in a given coding session, which one needs me most? 

It's clear that waiting around to get inspired, like I was when i first started the projects, isn't going to work. The inspiration phase of most of the  projects has passed -- perhaps to return -- and a sort of "perspiration" phase has begun. I'm going to have to make some priorities, and I'm going to have to tackle some front end issues that I've been avoiding like the plague.

It'll be good for me :)

After falling in love with Sinatra's simplicity and what seemed like "powerful-enough" features, I was a little wary of Rails' comparative bloat. As I was introduced to generators and gems, routing and forms, I couldn't help but think "this is all a little toooo magical, isn't it?"

And the short answer is, "sort of." 

I think the magic of Rails is totally too much for someone like me a year ago. It sounded so easy when following along with a tutorial, and then of course the moment something went slightly awry, I had absolutely no idea what to do. I had no understanding of what the magic was doing, no vocabulary to even describe the magic, or the errors.

Now, after spending some quality time building up a stronger foundation and honing my chops at Flatiron, I know enough about Rails magic to get myself in trouble, and much of the time, enough knowledge to get myself back out of that trouble. I still have a LOT to learn about some things going on under the hood, and about validations and authentications and activerecord queries and..and...and...

But I feel equipped to tackle Rails projects and recognize familiar territory,  to wield some of these amazing tools skillfully, and ultimately, to make functional, minimally featured apps that have sensible database relationships and navigable,  appropriate code.

I am stoked! Rails makes me feel like some kind of app-generating god. It makes my inner Maker, my shadow entrepreneur so very tickled just thinking about the possibilities this simple kind of "power" grants to those willing to put in some time getting to know it. That's what this whole coding journey has been about, after all -- Possibility.

Well just when I was really getting the hang of the ole object-oriented consciousness... we've added Javascript to the front end. 

While exciting for the smooth feel of asynchronous functionality, it's also been an uncomfortable transition in some ways. Wait, didn't I already make objects? Aren't they in my database, even? Why on Earth am I making the same objects into objects of a different flavor?  It seems like twice the work!

Of course, there are excellent reasons, which I soon discovered. Like many "great" discoveries, I made this one by doing everything the wrong way first, noticing the  pain points, and then realizing that a solution existed. Namely, I noticed how awkward it was to play hot potato with my data in a DOM/JS context. I kept hiding attributes in html and then writing loooooong code snippets that should have been nice, neat little functions.

Oh! So that's why it's a good idea to create Javascript objects :)  After some much-needed refactoring with this "hybrid" JS/Rails project, I'll be excited to get on to React and see what it's all about.

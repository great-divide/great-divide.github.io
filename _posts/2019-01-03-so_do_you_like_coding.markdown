Here is a typical dialogue between me and a friend who's catching up on my code school progress:

Friend:  How's code school going?

Me:  Great! I'm on track to be done in about __ weeks!

Friend:  So do you like it, coding?

Me:  Yep.

Friend:  What do you like about it?

Me:  <b><i>Solvable Problems.</b></i>

Friend:  What do you mean?

Me:  Well, I think that in most cases with coding, the coder is presented with something <i>broken</i>, and then asked to fix it. And most of the time, fixing it is a matter of chipping away at a series of small, solvable problems. 

Friend:  Go on.

Me:  And solving these little problems is both super frustrating when I'm stuck, and invigorating when I'm done. I think most coders must be, at some level, addicted to that sort of up and down, or at least to the dopamine hit that our brains give us when we finally solve something.

Friend: So you'll be addicted to your job?

Me:  Doesn't sound so bad, really. At least my neurochemistry would make me enjoy it on some level, and even pull me toward being a <i>good</i> employee, in that way.

Friend: And your co-workers will all be like strung out brainiacs? I dunno...

Me: Maybe! But really I think the job doesn't require brainiacs at most levels. Probably doesn't hurt, but <b>I think a big part of the job is simply being able to describe a problem well enough to google for an answer and recognize a good solution when you see it. </b>

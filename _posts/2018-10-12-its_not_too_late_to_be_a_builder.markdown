My mom brought home our first family computer -- a Macintosh Plus -- in 1986 or so. I wrote code for the first time in 7th grade. It was 1993 and I copied some rudimentary lines of BASIC out of a 3-2-1 Contact magazine. I don't remember what it did, but it was cool.

Time went by. I went to college and majored in apathy. I never even considered taking a comp sci class (the whole scene seemed way too nerdy). I learned some html and made a few websites in Flash and Dreamweaver (wow, how awful was making websites with Dreamweaver?), and eventually I went to work for a graphic design company that promptly went bankrupt two months later.

All along, I had a nagging since of missing out on something important, but I figured I'd missed the boat with the whole "tech/computer thing". And I continued to think that for another 13 years...

As it's turned out,  that whole "tech/computer thing" took over life as we knew it. And my nagging sense of missing out never went anywhere either. 

I finally just had to find a way to **participate!** There is fun being had and work being done and problems being solved, and even money being made... and I want to be part of it! 

So, here I am. Let's build something.
